# What's new in Visual Studio 2019

**Updated for the [16.0 release](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes/)**

>[!div class="button"]
>[Download Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2019)

With Visual Studio 2019, you'll get best-in-class tools and services for any developer, any app, and any platform. Whether you're using Visual Studio for the first time or you've been using it for years, there's a lot to like in this new version!

Here's a high-level recap of what's new:

* **[Develop](#develop)**: Stay focused and productive with improved performance, instant code cleanup, and better search results.
* **[Collaborate](#collaborate)**: Enjoy natural collaboration through a Git-first workflow, real-time editing and debugging, and code reviews right in Visual Studio.
* **[Debug](#debug)**: Highlight and navigate to specific values, optimize memory use, and take automatic snapshots of your application's execution.

For a complete list of everything that's new in this version, see the [release notes](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes/).

## Develop

Save time with new features.

### Improved search

Formerly known as Quick Launch, our new search experience is faster and more effective. Now, search results appear dynamically as you type. And, search results can often include keyboard shortcuts for commands, so that you can more easily memorize them for future use.

   ![An animation of the new search experience in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/new-search-feature.gif)

The new fuzzy search logic will find anything you need, regardless of typos. So, whether you're looking for commands, settings, documentation, or other useful things, the new search feature makes it easier to find what you're looking for.

### Refactorings

There are lots of new and highly useful refactorings in C# that make it easier to organize your code. They show up as suggestions in the light bulb and include actions such as moving members to interface or base class, adjusting namespaces to match folder structure, convert foreach-loops to Linq queries, and more.

   ![An animation of the refactorings experience in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/refactorings.gif)

Simply invoke the refactorings by pressing **Ctrl+.** and selecting the action you want to take.

### IntelliCode

[Visual Studio IntelliCode](/visualstudio/intellicode/) is an extension that enhances your software development efforts by using artificial intelligence (AI). IntelliCode trains across 2,000 open-source projects on GitHub&mdash;each with over 100 stars&mdash;to generate its recommendations.

 ![An animation of IntelliCode in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/IntelliCode.gif)

Here are a few ways that Visual Studio IntelliCode can help enhance your productivity:

* Deliver context-aware code completions
* Guide developers to adhere to the patterns and styles of their team
* Find difficult-to-catch code issues
* Focus code reviews by drawing attention to areas that really matter

We initially supported only C# when we first previewed the IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio. Now, we've added support for C++ and XAML in Visual Studio, too.

And if you're using C#, we've also added the ability to train a custom model on your own code.

For more information about IntelliCode, see the [Code more, scroll less with Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-more-scroll-less-with-visual-studio-intellicode/) blog post.

### Code cleanup

Paired with a new document health indicator is a new code cleanup command. You can use this new command to identify and then fix both warnings and suggestions with the click of a button.

The cleanup will format the code and apply any code fixes as suggested by the [current settings](code-styles-and-code-cleanup.md) and [.editorconfig files](create-portable-custom-editor-options.md).

   ![A screenshot of the new code cleanup control in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/code-cleanup-profile.png)

You can also save collections of fixers as a profile. For example, if you have a small set of targeted fixers that you apply frequently while you code, and then you have another comprehensive set of fixers to apply before a code review, you can configure profiles to address these different tasks.

## Collaborate

Team up to solve issues.

### Cloud-first workflow

Something you'll notice when you open Visual Studio 2019 is its new start window.

   ![A screenshot of the new start window in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/start-window-dark.png)

The start window presents you with several options to get you to code quickly. We've placed the option to clone or check out code from a repo, first.

   ![An animation of the 'Git-first' experience in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/git-first.gif)

The start window also includes options to open a project or solution, open a local folder, or create a new project.

For more information, see the [Get to code: How we designed the new Visual Studio start window](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/get-to-code-how-we-designed-the-new-visual-studio-start-window/) blog post.

### Live Share

[Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) is a developer service that allows you to share a codebase and its context with a teammate and get instant bidirectional collaboration directly from within Visual Studio. With Live Share, a teammate can read, navigate, edit, and debug a project that you've shared with them, and do so seamlessly and securely.

And with Visual Studio 2019, this service is installed by default.

![An animation that shows the Live Share collaboration feature in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/live-share.gif)

For more information, see the [Visual Studio Live Share for real-time code reviews and interactive education](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-live-share-for-real-time-code-reviews-and-interactive-education/) blog post and the [Live Share now included with Visual Studio 2019](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/live-share-now-included-with-visual-studio-2019/) blog post.

### Integrated code reviews

We're introducing a new extension that you can download to use with Visual Studio 2019. With this new extension, you can review, run, and even debug pull requests from your team without leaving Visual Studio. We support code in both GitHub and Azure DevOps repositories.

   ![A screenshot of the new start window in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/pr-experience.png)

To get started now, download the [Pull Requests for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/pr4vs) extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Debug

Zero in with precise targeting.

### Performance gains

We've taken the once-exclusive C++ data breakpoints and adapted them for .NET Core applications.

   ![An animation that shows the debug data breakpoints in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/debug-data-breakpoints.gif)

So whether you're coding in C++ or .NET Core, data breakpoints can be a good alternative to just placing regular breakpoints. Data breakpoints are also great for scenarios such as finding where a global object is being modified or being added or removed from a list.

And, if you're a C++ developer who develops large applications, Visual Studio 2019 has made symbols out of proc, which allows you to debug those applications without experiencing memory-related issues.

### Search while debugging

You've probably been there before, looking in the Watch window for a string amongst a set of values. In Visual Studio 2019, we've added search in the Watch, Locals, and Autos windows to help you find the objects and values you're looking for.

   ![An animation that shows the debug search window in Visual Studio 2019](media/vs-2019/debug-window-search.gif)

You can also format how a value is displayed within the Watch, Locals, and Autos windows.  Double-click one of the items in any of the windows and add a comma (",") to access the drop-down list of possible format specifiers, each of which includes a description of its intended effect.

   ![The new Watch window and format values feature in Visual Studio 2019](media/search-watch-window.png)

For more information, see the [Enhanced in Visual Studio 2019: Search for Objects and Properties in the Watch, Autos, and Locals Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/enhanced-in-visual-studio-2019-search-for-objects-and-properties-in-the-watch-autos-and-locals-windows/) blog post.

### Snapshot Debugger

Get a snapshot of your app's execution in the cloud to see exactly what's happening. (This feature is available in Visual Studio Enterprise, only.)

   ![An animation that shows the Snapshot Debugger in Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise](media/vs-2019/snapshot-debugger.gif)

We've added support for targeting ASP.NET (Core and desktop) applications that run on an Azure VM. And, we've added support for applications that run in an Azure Kubernetes Service. The Snapshot Debugger can help you dramatically reduce the time it takes to resolve issues that occur in production environments.

For more information, see the [Debug live ASP.NET Azure apps using the Snapshot Debugger](../debugger/debug-live-azure-applications.md) page, and the [Introducing Time Travel Debugging for Visual Studio Enterprise 2019](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/introducing-time-travel-debugging-for-visual-studio-enterprise-2019/) blog post.
